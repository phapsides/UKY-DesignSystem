Headings are used to break up sections of content and to create a clear hierarchy.

## When to use this component

When providing shortform text copy that is not rich text or body copy.

## When to consider something else

For rich text content (such as what is provided by a CMS), use the Prose component.

## Guidance

Write headings in sentence case. These are easiest for users to read.

## Accessibility

Screen readers provide utilities that allow the user to view and navigate through the page's heading hierarchy. Make sure that headings make sense when read out of context, and that they use the most appropriate `<h#>` element for the location in the content hierarchy.

## Browser considerations

None.
