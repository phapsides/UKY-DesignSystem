Cards provide a brief, easily digestible summary of a larger body of content, and will most commonly be found on section landing pages.

The Card component acts as a generic base for which to build content cards from.

Cards are built of four other components, all but one of which is optional.

- [Heading]({{ '/components/detail/heading' | path }}) (required)
- [Image]({{ '/components/detail/image' | path }})

Other components may be included with call data. Usually this will be the [Prose]({{ '/components/detail/prose' | path }}) component.

Cards are best used in combination with a layout component, such as a [Grid]({{ '/components/detail/grid' | path }}) or [Stack]({{ '/components/detail/stack' | path }}).

## When to use this component

When you need to provide a summary of a large body of content, such as multiple courses, events or content pages.

## When to consider something else

## Guidance

Cards are best utilised when making up groups of related but different content. Cards within a group are all expected to be visually similar and have the same functions available for each one.

If it is necessary for some Cards to look or function differently to others, consider splitting those Cards into their own section.
